#' Measure of durational variability of events
#'
#' This function calculates of durational variability of events (nPVI).
#'
#' This measure is borne out of language research. It has been noted that 
#' the variability of vowel duration is greater in stress- vs. syllable-timed 
#' languages (Grabe & Low, 2002). This measure accounts for the 
#' variability of durations and is also called "normalized Pairwise Variability 
#' Index" (nPVI). Patel & Daniele have applied it to music (2003) by comparing
#' whether the prosody of different languages is also reflected in music. There is 
#' a clear difference between a sample of works by French and English composers.

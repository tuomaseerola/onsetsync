\title{Create a continuous vector of onsets with a sampling in Hz}
\usage{
gaussify_onsets(data = NULL, sr = 500, wlen = 0.04, plot = FALSE, time = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame to be processed with discrete time points (onsets)}

\item{sr}{Sampling rate (default 50 Hz)}

\item{wlen}{Window length of percentage of the sr}

\item{plot}{If a plot is needed}

\item{time}{Time samples to be included in the output}
}
\value{
Output contain vector of onset times
}
\description{
This is a conversion function that turns onsets into sampled time-series.

\description{
This function calculates of durational variability of events (nPVI).
}
\details{
This measure is borne out of language research. It has been noted that 
the variability of vowel duration is greater in stress- vs. syllable-timed 
languages (Grabe & Low, 2002). This measure accounts for the 
variability of durations and is also called "normalized Pairwise Variability 
Index" (nPVI). Patel & Daniele have applied it to music (2003) by comparing
whether the prosody of different languages is also reflected in music. There is 
a clear difference between a sample of works by French and English composers.
